> [!NOTE]
> The original prject is still in active development, I am using the scripts that Chris had developed for his utility as I do not need a GUI-based app. Please consider [submitting feedback](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/macutil/issues) if you do.

My change is to focus on system performance (removing animations, fixing Finder, etc.) and removing the GUI tool so I can run the scripts via terminal. Most of the scripts for application installs have been removed, except the Neovim install script, and I combined the browser scripts into a single script.
